# Lotc-demo

## Demo project for LOTC

Side note, the git repo is a bit messy with some deleted files. There was a part of the project that is being tracked for duel development but was not needed for this demo.

##### Dogs++

This plugin added all sorts of features for your minecraft dogs. From dog whistles that would summon them to you, bells you could ring to asemble them all, it even supported grouping your dogs by the color of their tag and only interacting with those dogs.

This plugin we a recreation of the LOTC 1.9 PvP plugin Surge, it has been used on several PvP practice servers by various nations. It is currently the highest rated Surge-Like PvP system out there. Far surpasing the systems created with command blocks.
